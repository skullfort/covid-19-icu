# COVID-19 in Ontario: A Glance from the ICUs

**Group Members**: Carly Yiao, Helin Kanya, Hardik Gehlot, Mingyao Gu

**Overview:**

ICU beds occupancy is a good indicator of the seriousness of the pandemic and how well prepared Ontario healthcare was to the response of the pandemic of this scale.

**Questions and Definitions:**

1. How does the occupancy change overtime in Ontario?

2. Is the occupancy changes the same for adults and underaged people in Ontario?

3. Were there enough ICU beds during peak times and were hospitals equiped enough during the fluctuating pandemic situation?

5. Do different regions in Ontario follow certain trends or have similiarities/differences in data?

Pediactrics: Children, Adolescence, and Teens (Under 18)

**Analysis:**

WHAT WE NEED TO WRITE UNDER EACH QUESTION: Title, What visualization we are using, Explanation of what the graph is showing, summarize findings (supported with numbers), and related statistical analysis from lessons (e.g., aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and  timeseries analysis)

1. How does the occupancy change overtime in Ontario?
- The bed required for adults increased over the time but the beds required for pediatrics remained same.
- Adults were more prone to critical covid infections which increases over the time.
2. Is the occupancy changes the same for adults and underaged people in Ontario?
- correlation graph 
- shows that adults are more likely to have complicated cases of covid-19
- adult ICU occupancy have more spikes than pediatrics
- underaged people for ICU occupancy remained at a relative slope which shows they have more immunity against covid-19 than the adults. 

3. Were there enough ICU beds during peak times and were hospitals equiped enough during the fluctuating pandemic situation?
- line graph
- Sudden spike in cases shows hospitals were not having enough oxygen beds available for adults.
- The availabilty of beds went down for non-covid related disease.
- the underaged hospital equipment dipped below the required ICU beds, meaning that hospitals were not well equiped during that dip in the graph

4. Do different regions in Ontario follow certain trends or have similiarities/differences in data?
- pie chart 
- The other regions were having the same rate of covid spread
- different regions have similar spikes in ICU beds being used

**Conclusion:**
After conducting this study, we think the following points
- The hospitals across Canada were poorly ready for a large influx of hospitalization. 
- Adult patients were more likely to form complicated covid cases and thus adults had more hospitalization rate.
- Pediatric patients had lower hospitalization rate and thus showing more immunity against covid-19.
- The correlation graph shows the reduction in beds for non-covid-related diseases. 
- the other regions were seen the same soike in cases.
