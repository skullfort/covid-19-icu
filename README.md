# COVID-19 in Ontario: A Glance from the ICUs

**Group Members**: Carly Yiao, Helin Kanya, Hardik Gehlot, Mingyao Gu

**Overview:**

ICU beds occupancy is a good indicator of the seriousness of the pandemic and how well prepared Ontario healthcare was to the response of the pandemic of this scale.

**Questions and Definitions:**

1. What kind of trends of Covid-19 overtime in Ontario?

2. Do different regions in Ontario follow certain trends or have similiarities/differences in data?

3. Is the occupancy changes the same for adults and underaged people in Ontario?

4. Were there enough ICU beds during peak times and were hospitals equiped enough during the fluctuating pandemic situation?

Pediactrics: Children, Adolescence, and Teens (Under 18)

**Analysis:**

WHAT WE NEED TO WRITE UNDER EACH QUESTION: Title, What visualization we are using, Explanation of what the graph is showing, summarize findings (supported with numbers), and related statistical analysis from lessons (e.g., aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and  timeseries analysis)

1. What kind of trends of Covid-19 overtime in Ontario?
- The occupancy in the data visualizations shown describes spikes, dips, and steady slopes in the occupancy change overtime in Ontario. These spikes correlate to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and affected people rates in Ontario. The spikes are when the stricter laws of social distancing are installed. 

- The first wave happened March 2020, second wave was in the beginning of 2021, third wave was the highest peak variant in may 2021, fourth wave is omicron feb 2022. 

- Adults were more prone to critical covid infections which increases over the time.

2. Do different regions in Ontario follow certain trends or have similiarities/differences in data?
- Some observations that can be made are the adult ICU occupancies have more spikes than pediatrics and that underaged people for ICU occupancy remained at a relative slope. This means that adult ICUs are better prepared for than pediatrics. And there is a vast difference in how COVID-19 affected more adults than underaged people to a more critical health level. The most prominent surges in the counts of adult patients correspond to the major waves of COVID-19, including the spread of Omicron in early 2022. Overall, adults CRCI patients were always above or well above the amount of pediatric CRCI patients.

- In the heatmap graph, we can see that when the number of CRCI patients exceeds 200, which in reference to the time series of the adult CRCI patients corresponds to the major waves of COVID-19, there is an approximately linear relation between it and the total number of patients.

- In the scatterplot, we can observe that because the number of CRCI patients in ICUs remains low over the period of investigation, there is a strong linear relation between the number of non-CRCI patients and the total number of patients. Alarmingly, there has been a steady increase of late of non-CRCI pediatric patients in ICUs related to acute respiratory illnesses observed in Ontario from September 2022 onward, particularly in young children aged 0–4 years old. The cause is multi-faceted (from Richard's personal experience, provincial shortage of pediatric medication to treat fever).


3. Is the occupancy changes the same for adults and underaged people in Ontario?
- In the scatterplot for the “Availability of ICU beds”, we can see that there was never shortage of available ICU beds for adults. The same cannot be said about pediatric patients. Due to the recent steady increase in non-CRCI pediatric patients in ICUS, there was a period of 9 days last November when there were not enough ICU beds for pediatric patients. In the graph, we can see that at one point the underaged hospital were not equiped properly as seen from the dip below the required ICU beds. 

4. Were there enough ICU beds during peak times and were hospitals equiped enough during the fluctuating pandemic situation?
- Regions in Ontario show that there are more ICU beds being used for the Toronto region on average throughout the timeline. On the other hand, the smallest amount is for the Central region of Ontario. This can be related to varied population total in each of the 5 regions. Another thing to take into a factor is the density of people within the specific region. For example, Toronto is more dense and more people take public transit, walk, or bike to get to their destination. This means that it is harder to social distance as compared to more dispersed density populations such as East and Centreal regions of Ontario. 

- When it comes to the total sum of patients in each region, Central Ontario has the most (29.4%) patients whereas the North region has the least (4.3%).
	
- The box plot shows that outliers in each region with Toronto having the most and North having the least outliers. The graph also….

**Conclusion:**
After conducting this study, we think the following points
- The hospitals across Canada were poorly ready for a large influx of hospitalization. 
- Adult patients were more likely to form complicated covid cases and thus adults had more hospitalization rate.
- Pediatric patients had lower hospitalization rate and thus showing more immunity against covid-19.
- The correlation graph shows the reduction in beds for non-covid-related diseases. 
- the other regions were seen the same soike in cases.
